Runes are by far the most important resource in the game. It is hard acquiring them, but since you need runes for buildings, they are very important.

You can see the amount of unused runes in the Economy window.

Runes can be found all over the world. In order to find new runes, you will have to send your scouts out on a mission to find runes. Click your castle and scout for new runes.
